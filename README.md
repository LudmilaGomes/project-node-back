# Project | Biblioteca Virtual

## About the Project

<p>The idea for this project was developed to practice the use of Node.js and for projects in the Banco de Dados discipline.</p>
<p>Biblioteca Virtual is a system that manipulates and manages the data of a fictional library, storing information about books, users, sellers, fines, and loans.</p>

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run `yarn local` to run the server locally (after configuring the database on your machine), and the database will be ready to be used!

In the program directory (located at `project-node-back/program`), you can run `node mp.js` to access an interactive program. Within this program, you can utilize CRUD system methods to manage information and data within the Biblioteca Virtual.
